The server is runing Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and was installed on GCloud
The test server is a simply a compute instance, but if you prefer you can run this in a container.

The server is setup with NGINX so that www.aiogames.com/chart will access the node application.
This allows NGINX to handle the certificate (allowing https)

It is suggested to setup a sudo user with a certificate for logging in to make remote access easier.

First we install nginx

$ sudo apt install nginx

Then on following the lets-encrypt guide we setup CertBot
see  https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntufocal-nginx

Setup to only allow https for security.

Finally we setup the http redirect:

$ cd /etc/nginx/servers_enabled
# Use whatever editor you prefer.
$ vim default

In the server section for ssl under the "location /" block 
add the following.

    #Section to enable node application chart on port 3000 
    location /chart {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/; #The trailing / matters it node run as if called from / instead of /chart
    }

Install dependencies ass seen below. 

$ sudo apt install git
$ sudo apt install node
$ sudo apt install npm

Setup deploy keys for github if you have pulled this project and made it private. 
Or if you want to.

In a directory of your choosing, (I use ~/)
git clone git@github.com:Sarzorus/chart.git

Finally you may start and test the application 
Restart nginx if you haven't already since the changes.
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx

start the application in the background. 
$ cd chart
$ chmod +x Deployment/localRun.sh
$ ./Deployment/localRun.sh &
